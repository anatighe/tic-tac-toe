tic-tac-toe
===========

Tic-Tac-Toe game in Javascript

Written in Javascript; tested with Mocha and Chai; front end in jQuery, CSS and HTML.

This game was created as part of the [Epicodus coding school](www.epicodus.com).

By completing this game I learned about TDD and object oriented programming.
